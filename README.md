=================

We are USTC-Software, a team from University of Science and Technology of China. We will be competing in iGem 2013!

###Introduction###
Our application aims to simulate genetic networks. The application analyzes the stability of genetic networks after introduction of exogenous genes. Meanwhile, given the original network and specific purposes, the application traces the regulative process back and gives possible regulative patterns.
